# Lists in HTML 

There are lots of occasions when we need to use lists. 
HTML provides us with three different types: 

● Ordered list are lists where each item in the list is numbered. 

● Unordered lists are lists that begin with a bullet point
  (rather than characters that indicate order).

● Definition lists are made up of a set of terms  This is used to contain the term being defined (the definition term),along with the
  definitions for each of those terms This is used to contain the definition.

  Lists can be nested inside one another.

 # Boxes in CSS 
 
 Every box has three available properties that
 can be adjusted to control its appearance:
 
 Border
 Every box has a border (even if  it is not visible or is specified to
 be 0 pixels wide). The border   separates the edge of one box
 from another.
 
 Margin
 Margins sit outside the edge  of the border. You can set the
 width of a margin to create a gap between the borders of two
 adjacent boxes.
 
 Padding
 Padding is the space between the border of a box and any
 content contained within it. Adding padding can increase the
 readability of its contents.

The padding and margin properties are very helpful in adding space between variouitems on the page.

 Block-level boxes can be made into inline boxes, and inline boxes made into block-level boxes.
 Legibility can be improved by controlling the width of boxes containing text and the leading.
 CSS3 has introduced the ability to create image borders and rounded borders.
 It is possible to hide elements using the display and visibility properties.

 # Arrays in JS 
 
 An array is a special type of variable. It doesn't just store one value; it stores a list of values. 
 
 VALUES IN ARRAYS
 Values in an array are accessed as if they are in a numbered list. It is important to know that the
 numbering of this list starts at zero (not one). 
 
 
 EXPRESSIONS
 An expression evaluates into (results in) a single value. Broadly speaking
 there are two types of expressions:
 1
 EXPRESSIONS THAT JUST ASSIGN A VALUE TO A VARIABLE 
 2
EXPRESSIONS THAT USE TWO OR MORE VALUES TO RETURN A
SINGLE VALUE

## SWITCH STATEMENTS
 A switch statement starts with a variable called the switch value.
 Each case indicates a possible value for this variable and the
 code that should run if the variable matches that value.
 
 
 switch (level) {
case 'One ':
title= 'Level 1 ' ;
break;
case 'Two':
tit 1 e = ' Level 2 ' ;
break;
case ' Three' :
title = 'Level 3' ;
break ;
default :
title= 'Test';
break; 

SWITCH
• You have a default option that is run if none of the cases match.
• If a match is found, that code is run; then the break statement stops the rest of
  the switch statement running (providing better performance than multiple if statements). 


## JavaScript Loops

Loops can execute a block of code a number of times.

for loop :
for (initialization; condition; increment)  
{  
    code to be executed  
}  


while loop :

The JavaScript while loop iterates the elements for the infinite number of times.
It should be used if number of iteration is not known. 
The syntax of while loop is given below.

while (condition)  
{  
    code to be executed  
}  

JavaScript do while loop
The JavaScript do while loop iterates the elements for the infinite number of times like while loop. 
But, code is executed at least once whether condition is true or false. 
The syntax of do while loop is given below.

do{  
    code to be executed  
}while (condition);
