# A SCRIPT IS A SERI ES OF
# INSTRUCTIONS 

A script is a series of instructions that a
computer can follow to achieve a goal. 

To write a script, you need to first
state your goal and then list the
tasks that need to be completed in
order to achieve it. 

Start with the big picture of what
you want to achieve, and break
that down into smaller steps.
