# Images 

There are many reasons why you might want to add an image to a web page: you
might want to include a logo, photograph, illustration, diagram, or chart.

To add an image into the page you need to use an <img>
element. This is an empty element (which means there is
no closing tag).

There are three rules to remember when you
are creating images for your website which are
summarized below:
 * Save images in the right format
 * Save images at the right size
 * Use the correct resolution
 
 
 There are several tools you can use to edit and
 save images to ensure that they are the right
 size, format, and resolution.:
 
 ##  cropping images
 When cropping images it is important not to
lose valuable information. It is best to source
images that are the correct shape if possible.

## mage Resolution
Images created for the web should be saved at
a resolution of 72 ppi. The higher the resolution
of the image, the larger the size of the file.

Images often come with captions. HTML5 has introduced
a new <figure> element to contain images and their caption
so that the two are associated. You can have more than one
image inside the <figure> element as long as they all share
the same caption.

  # colors 
  
  The color property allows you to specify the color of text inside
  an element. You can specify any color in CSS in one of three ways:
  
 rgb values
These express colors in terms of how much red, green and
blue are used to make it up. For example: rgb(100,100,90)

 hex codes
These are six-digit codes that represent the amount of red,
green and blue in a color,preceded by a pound or hash #
sign. For example: #ee3e80

color names
There are 147 predefined color names that are recognized
by browsers. For example: DarkCyan  
  
  
## CSS3 introduces the opacity

property which allows you to specify the opacity of an element
and any of its child elements. The value is a number between
0.0 and 1.0 (so a value of 0.5 is 50% opacity and 0.15 is 15% opacity).

 Color pickers can help you find the color you want.
 
 It is important to ensure that there is enough contrast
between any text and the background color (otherwise
people will not be able to read your content).

 CSS3 has introduced an extra value for RGB colors to
indicate opacity. It is known as RGBA.

CSS3 also allows you to specify colors as HSL values,
with an optional opacity value. It is known as HSLA.
