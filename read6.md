# Understanding The Problem Domain Is The Hardest Part Of Programming


What is the hardest thing about writing code?

There are many common answers to this question:

Learning a new technology
Naming things
Testing your code
Debugging
Fixing bugs
Making software maintainable
The list goes on and on

The big issue is that many problem domains are like a puzzle with a blurry picture or no picture at all.

The real world is a messy place.  Many of the problem domains we face as programmers are difficult to understand and look completely different depending on your viewpoint.
If understanding the problem domain is the hardest part of programming and you want to make programming easier, you can do one of two things:

* Make the problem domain easier
* Get better at understanding the problem domain

# WHAT IS AN OBJECT?
Objects group together a set of variables and functions to create a model
of a something you would recognize from the real world. In an object,
variables and functions take on new names.

IN AN OBJECT: VARIABLES BECOME KNOWN AS PROPERTIES 
IN AN OBJECT: FUNCTIONS BECOME KNOWN AS METHODS 

## You define (and create) a JavaScript object with an object literal:
   Example
var person = {firstName:"John", lastName:"Doe", age:50, eyeColor:"blue"};
The name:values pairs in JavaScript objects are called properties:

## Accessing Object Properties
You can access object properties in two ways:

objectName.propertyName
or
objectName["propertyName"]

## Object Methods
Objects can also have methods.
Methods are actions that can be performed on objects.
Methods are stored in properties as function definitions.
>A method is a function stored as a property.

## Accessing Object Methods
You access an object method with the following syntax:

objectName.methodName()
