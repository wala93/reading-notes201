# Introduction to CSS layout
This article will recap some of the CSS layout features we've already touched upon in previous 
modules — such as different display values — and introduce some of 
the concepts we'll be covering throughout this module.

Normal Flow
Elements on webpages lay themselves out according to normal flow - until we do something to change that. 
This article explains the basics of normal flow as a grounding for learning how to change it.

Flexbox
Flexbox is a one-dimensional layout method for laying out items in rows or columns. Items flex to fill
additional space and shrink to fit into smaller spaces. This article explains all the fundamentals.

Grids
CSS Grid Layout is a two-dimensional layout system for the web. It lets you lay content out in rows and columns, 
and has many feature that make building complex layouts straightforward. This article will give you all you need to know to get started with page layout.

Floats
Originally for floating images inside blocks of text, the float property became one of the most commonly used tools for creating multiple
column layouts on webpages. With the advent of Flexbox and Grid it has now returned to its original purpose, as this article explains.


Positioning
Positioning allows you to take elements out of the normal document layout flow, and make them behave differently,
for example sitting on top of one another, or always remaining in the same place inside the browser viewport. 
This article explains the different position values, and how to use them.

Multiple-column layout
The multiple-column layout specification gives you a method of laying content out in columns, as you might see in a newspaper.
This article explains how to use this feature.

Legacy layout methods
Grid systems are a very common feature used in CSS layouts, and before CSS Grid Layout they tended to be implemented using floats or other layout features. 
You imagine your layout as a set number of columns (e.g. 4, 6, or 12), and then fit your content columns inside these imaginary columns. 
In this article we'll explore how these older methods work, in order that you understand how they were used if you work on an older project.


Supporting older browsers
In this module we recommend using Flexbox and Grid as the main layout methods for your designs. However there will be visitors to
your site who use older browsers, or browsers which do not support the methods you have used. This will always be the
case on the web — as new features are developed, different browsers will prioritise different things. This article
explains how to use modern web techniques without locking out users of older technology.
