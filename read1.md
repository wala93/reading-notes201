# A SCRIPT IS A SERI ES OF
# INSTRUCTIONS 

A script is a series of instructions that a
computer can follow to achieve a goal. 

To write a script, you need to first
state your goal and then list the
tasks that need to be completed in
order to achieve it. 

Start with the big picture of what
you want to achieve, and break
that down into smaller steps. 


FROM STEPS
TO CODE

Every step for every task shown
in a flowchart needs to be written
in a language the computer can
understand and follow.

**HTML**
HTML Documents
All HTML documents must start with a document type declaration: <!DOCTYPE html>.

The HTML document itself begins with <html> and ends with </html>.

The visible part of the HTML document is between <body> and </body>.

HTML Headings
HTML headings are defined with the <h1> to <h6> tags.

HTML Paragraphs
HTML paragraphs are defined with the <p> tag:

HTML Links
HTML links are defined with the <a> tag:

Example
<a href="https://www.w3schools.com">This is a link</a>

 ~HTML5 is introducing a new set of~
elements that help define the structure of
a page.
They are covered here (rather than with the other HTML
elements you met earlier in the book) because you'll find
it easier to understand how they can be used now that you
have seen how CSS can control the layout a page. These
new elements are going to play an important part in creating
layouts going forward. In this chapter you will see:
● The new HTML5 layout elements and their uses
● How they offer helpful alternatives to the <div> element
● How to ensure older browsers recognize these elements
As with all HTML5 and CSS3 content, its usage is still
subject to change but it is already widely being used by web
developers and it is likely that you will want to use them

## <article>
The <article> element acts as
a container for any section of a
page that could stand alone and
potentially be syndicated.


Heading Groups
<hgroup>

The purpose of the <hgroup>
element is to group together a
set of one or more <h1> through
<h6> elements so that they are
treated as one single heading. 



Helping Older
Browsers Understand

Older browsers that do not
know the new HTML5 elements
will automatically treat them as
inline elements. Therefore, to
help older browsers, you should
include the line of CSS on the
left which states which new
elements should be rendered as
block-level elements.
Also, IE9 was the first version of
Internet Explorer to allow CSS
rules to be associated with these
new HTML5 layout elements.
In order to style these elements
using earlier versions of IE, you
need to use a simple JavaScript
known as the HTML5 shiv or
HTML5 shim. 


>The new HTML5 elements indicate the purpose of
>different parts of a web page and help to describe
>its structure.
>X The new elements provide clearer code (compared
>with using multiple <div> elements).
>X Older browsers that do not understand HTML5
>elements need to be told which elements are
>block-level elements.
>X To make HTML5 elements work in Internet Explorer 8
>(and older versions of IE), extra JavaScript is needed,
>which is available free from Google.

How to approach building a site?

X Understanding your audience and their needs
X How to present information visitors want to see
X It's important to understand who your target audience



is, why they would come to your site, what information
they want to find and when they are likely to return.
X Site maps allow you to plan the structure of a site.
X Wireframes allow you to organize the information that
will need to go on each page.
X Design is about communication. Visual hierarchy helps
visitors understand what you are trying to tell them.
X You can differentiate between pieces of information
using size, color, and style.
X You can use grouping and similarity to help simplify
the information you present.
