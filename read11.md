# images 
You can specify the dimensions of images using CSS.
This is very helpful when you use the same sized
images on several pages of your site.

 Images can be aligned both horizontally and vertically
using CSS.

You can use a background image behind the box
created by any element on a page.

Background images can appear just once or be
repeated across the background of the box.

You can create image rollover effects by moving the
background position of an image.

To reduce the number of images your browser has to
load, you can create image sprites.
