# What Google Learned From Its Quest to Build the Perfect Team

Our data-saturated age enables us to examine our work habits and office quirks 
with a scrutiny that our cubicle-bound forebears could only dream of. Today,
on corporate campuses and within university laboratories, psychologists, sociologists 
and statisticians are devoting themselves to studying everything from team composition
to email patterns in order to figure out how to make employees into faster, better and 
more productive versions of themselves. ‘‘We’re living through a golden age of 
understanding personal productivity,’’ says Marshall Van Alstyne, a professor at Boston 
University who studies how people share information. ‘‘All of a sudden, we can pick apart
the small choices that all of us make, decisions most of us don’t even notice, and figure 
out why some people are so much more effective than everyone else.’’

 In a 2015 study, executives said that profitability increases when workers are persuaded to collaborate more.
 Within companies and conglomerates, as well as in government agencies and schools, teams are now the fundamental 
 unit of organization. If a company wants to outstrip its competitors, it needs to influence not only
 how people work but also how they work together.
 
 
 The company’s top executives long believed that building the best teams meant combining the best people. 
 They embraced other bits of conventional wisdom as well, like ‘‘It’s better to put introverts together,’’ 
 said Abeer Dubey, a manager in Google’s People Analytics
 division, or ‘‘Teams are more effective when everyone is friends away from work.’’ 
 But, Dubey went on, ‘‘it turned out no one had really studied which of those were true.’’
 
 No matter how researchers arranged the data, though, it was almost impossible to find patterns — or 
 any evidence that the composition of a team made any difference. ‘‘We looked at 180 teams from all
 over the company,’’ Dubey said. ‘‘We had lots of data
 , but there was nothing showing that a mix of specific personality types or skills or 
 backgrounds made any difference. The ‘who’ part of the equation didn’t seem to matter.’

 What interested the researchers most, however, was that teams that did well on one assignment
 usually did well on all the others. Conversely, teams that failed at one thing seemed to fail
 at everything. The researchers eventually concluded that what distinguished the ‘‘good’’ teams
 from the dysfunctional groups was how teammates treated one another. The right norms, in other words, 
 could raise a group’s collective intelligence, whereas the wrong norms could hobble a team, even if,
 individually, all the members were exceptionally bright.
 
 
 
 
 As the researchers studied the groups, however, they noticed two behaviors that all the good teams
 generally shared. First, on the good teams, members spoke in roughly the same proportion, a phenomenon 
 the researchers referred to as ‘‘equality in distribution of conversational turn-taking.’’ On some teams,
 everyone spoke during each task; on others, leadership shifted among teammates from assignment to
 assignment. But in each case, by the end of the day, everyone had spoken roughly the same amount. ‘‘As long as
 everyone got a chance to talk, the team did well,’’ Woolley said. ‘‘But if only one person or 
 a small group spoke all the time, the collective intelligence declined.’
 
 
 
 Second, the good teams all had high ‘‘average social sensitivity’’ — a fancy way of saying they were
 skilled at intuiting how others felt based on their tone of voice, their expressions and other nonverbal cues.
 One of the easiest ways to gauge social sensitivity is to show someone photos of people’s eyes and
 ask him or her to describe what the people are thinking or feeling — an exam known as the Reading
 the Mind in the Eyes test. People on the more successful teams in Woolley’s experiment scored above
 average on the Reading the Mind in the Eyes test. They seemed to know when someone was feeling upset or left out.
 People on the ineffective teams, in contrast, scored below average. They seemed, as a group, to have
 less sensitivity toward their colleagues.
 
 In other words, if you are given a choice between the serious-minded Team A or the free-flowing Team B, 
 you should probably opt for Team B. Team A may be filled with smart people, all optimized for peak individual efficiency. 
 But the group’s norms discourage equal speaking; there are few exchanges of the kind of personal information that lets
 teammates pick up on what people are feeling or leaving unsaid. There’s a good chance the members of Team A will continue 
 to act like individuals  once they come together, and there’s little to suggest that, as a group, they will become more collectively intelligent.
